# ocv_libs
libraries based on opencv,eigen,boost and intel tbb

This library is intent to 

1 : provide some algorithms do not exist in the opencv yet, like generic for_each algorithm, generic parallel_for_each algorithm

2 : machine learning part is only for practice, I use(and contribute to) mlpack to do finish the deep learning tasks

3 : wrap up some tedious to use algorithms of opencv
